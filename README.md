# Html Practice for course

- I used font-awesome for icons.
- base on [this](http://htmunique.justthemevalley.com/) for practice.
- <del>compile by Easy LESS and pug2html.</del>
    - You can still use Easy LESS to Compile files, settings still include in less file.
- compile by Prepros.

## Knowing issue

- <del>the h1 tag covers other forms at top</del>
- I can't select carousel-area's sponsor by nth selector.
- some font size is not adjust.
- footer is not done.
