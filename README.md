# Html Practice for course

- I used font-awesome for icons.
- base on [this](http://htmunique.justthemevalley.com/) for practice.
- compile by Easy LESS and pug2html.

## Knowing issue
- nav's empty border has no clearly solution.
- I can't select carousel-area's sponsor by nth selector.
- some font size is not adjust.
- footer is not done.
- the h1 tag covers other forms at top, I tried to set z-index, but still can't avoid.
